            <div class="destext">
               <p>Tutorials are short courses focusing on learning the ropes of how to play as each character in the roster. Those can be found in the main menu under the icon shown here.</p>
               <p>Currently, only the tutorials for Mario, Sonic, and Shadow are considered complete.</p>

            <div>
               <p>Prove your skill in Poker Boll by collecting each of the 32 achievements available. Those can range from unlocking characters to finding easter eggs across levels. Unlocking achievements is indicated by a notification on the HUD.</p>
               <p>This feature is currently a Work in Progress, yet to be finished.</p>

         <h2>Super Forms</h2>
         <section class="description">
            <img src="images/icons/superforms.png">
            <div>
               <p>Collecting the 7 Chaos Emeralds allows Sonic, Tails, Knuckles and Amy to tap into the power of Super Form, which requires them to be at least in big form and have a minimum of 50 rings. This power drains the ring counter until it reaches 0, which causes the character to detransform. Using Super Forms enchances the user's abilities and some of their moves.</p>
               <p>Super Forms are also planned for other characters, such as Knuckles, Amy, Lilac. There'll also be some bonuses for collecting all Chaos Emeralds as other characters, like Shantae and Quote.</p>

         <h2>New Items</h2>
         <p>Poker Boll introduces two new items for characters to use, allowing for unique abilities.</p>
         <h3>Bubble Flower</h3>
         <p>This flower originates from Super Mario Bros. Wonder and grants the user water abilities. This item's behavior is planned to change.</p>
         <h3>Spark Flower
         </h3>
         <p>This power-up is a Poker Boll original item allowing user to access electric abilities, this power-up once got resprited.
         </p>

         <h2>New Biomes</h2>
         <p></p>
         <h3>Sakura</h3>
         <p>This biome is inspired by Japanese Cherry Blossom trees and one of Newer Super Mario Bros. Wii's worlds. With the addition of bamboo assets to compliment the scenery. </p>
         <h3>Mountain</h3>
         <p>This biome is one of the newer additions to Poker Boll. There may be some assets coming to the remake to add to it. It was inspired by New Super Mario Bros. for the Nintendo DS with some original twists to it, like the brown coloration.</p>

         <h2>Other Misc. Changes</h2>
         <h3>Mystery Ball</h3>
         <p>It was designed to be a Bowser Jr. drop, but for now it's just another way of ending a level. It may receive a new look in future versions...</p>
         <h3>Elemental Shields</h3>
         <p>4 new visual effects have been added to PB to be used in mods, as an extension of shields.png. Shield effects can be used in charms with variables: stareff, shieldeff, fireeff, thundereff, bubbleeff and windeff.</p>
         <h3>+ Clocks</h3>
         <p>These come in 2 variations - blue and green. Blue + Clocks add 10 seconds to your timer, green - a minute. This item was inspired by 3D Mario + Clocks.</p>
         <h3>Speed and Slug Shoes</h3>
         <p>Just like in Classic Sonic titles, Speed Shoes, as well as their evil counterpart - Slug Shoes, modify your speed. Speed Shoes also give you an afterimage effect.</p>
         <h3>Commands</h3>
         <p>Poker Boll features 2 new exclusive commands:
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>nohud - Disables the HUD for clean shots
            <li>speedhoes/iseeawoman/iamspeed - Infinite speed-up effect (can be used with spaces and underscores)
            </li>
            <h3>New afterimages</h3>
            <p>Rather than flashing on and off like in base Boll, the afterimages actually fade and not make breaks in rendering.</p>
